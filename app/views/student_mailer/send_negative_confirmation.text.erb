Hello <%= @student.name %>,

We're sorry to inform you that the class you registered for, <%= @course.title %>, didn't meet the minimum student requirement and will be cancelled. 

If the teacher decides to have the class anyways, you will receive a separate email from them. 

If you don't hear from the teacher and you're still interested in taking the class, let your teacher know!
<%= contact_teacher_url(:id => @course.id) %>

Cheers!
HourSchool HQ
