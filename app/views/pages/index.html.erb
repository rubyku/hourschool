    <div class="heading13-class">What happened to HourSchool?!</div>
    <p>Well, since school's out for summer, we're busy working on redesigning the HourSchool site based on your feedback! We're making it easier for you to learn what you want to learn, while meeting rad people and having fun. In-person classes are still at the core of what we do. Learn more about <%= link_to "what we're up to", about_path %>.</p> 


    <div class="heading13-class">What about the classes that were already posted?</div>
    <p>You can still sign up for them and you can find them on our new <%= link_to "Explore page", explore_path %>. All your past classes are available for viewing in your profile.</p>

    <div class="heading13-class">Where can I post my class? </div>
    <p>At the moment, you cannot post classes.  Once we relaunch in August, you'll be able to post classes again. We can't wait to share the new HourSchool with you.</p>

    <p>Love,<br>
    The HourSchool team</p>
