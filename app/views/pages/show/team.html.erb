          <div class="about-bio-team-blurb">"I’m a hungry bike riding doodler. I’ve lived in the US, Europe, and Asia, and love traveling light and getting lost. I enjoy making new things and talking about them, then making them better. At heart, however, I’m into old things, worn in things, things that have stories that can be told. I like those objects because they’re often attached to people who lead interesting lives, and those are the people I like to surround myself with."</div>

I thrive on turning ideas into reality and focus on execution. I love being in the mountains and water because they remind me to not live in a bubble. I spent most of my money on plane tickets, visiting my friends and family that live around the world. Hong Kong, Toronto, and Austin are all homes."</div>
