Those objects fascinate me because they're often attached to people who lead interesting lives, and those are the people I love to surround myself with. Think, make, share, rinse, and repeat.  I want to see the world through your lens and affect change locally.  I spend Sundays wrenching on old motorcycles, stop by anytime."</div>

Turning these ideas into reality is what makes me jump out of bed every morning. I love being in the water, on the mountains and by the rocks because they remind me to not live in a bubble. I spend almost all of my money on plane tickets, visiting my friends and family that live around the world. Hong Kong, Toronto, and Austin are all homes."</div>

When not at work, I'm either running the dirt trails of Town Lake or hanging upside down from my legs on a spinning pole. I like to stay busy, active, and hungry for learning but at the end of the day I find the most joy in the simple comfort of rubbing my corgi's fuzzy belly."</div>

            <div class="about-bio-team-blurb">I’m a native Texan, but I just moved back last year. Before coming to Austin, I lived in Atlanta, Singapore, LA, and SF.  I crave adventures, good food, music, and meeting people.  I believe in working hard to pursue your passions. And help others out along the way – life is too short to only think about yourself. I previously worked in the ad industry, and as glamorous as it was, I’m ready for new challenges.  When I’m not busy in classes or meetings, you’ll find me trying out new coffee shops, furiously cooking in the kitchen, or watching bad reality TV. If you ever want to go to the symphony, you can call me up. And if you ever want to explore a new part of the city, I’ll be there! You can say that I’m an urban dweller, but I would say I’m metro chic. See you around Austin!</div>
