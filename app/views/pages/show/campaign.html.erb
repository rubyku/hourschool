        <p>HourSchool has partnered with two organizations working to serve those who have lost their homes. We are collaborating and co-designing to help build a series of educational and capacity building programs, with a goal to instill a sense of self-worth for those who have lost hopes. </p>
      
        <div class="heading15-campaign">How you can help</div>
        <p>Teach a class or ask someone else to teach a class, and choose to donate your class proceeds towards our peer teaching fund! The fund will be used to plan events, cover cost of materials, and compensate time for trainers. Throughout our program, you will receive progress updates from HourSchool. You canâ€™t donate directly without teaching. Start teaching today, so you can empower someone else to do the same. </p>

        <div class="heading15-campaign">Returning to the founding story of HourSchool</div>
        <p>HourSchool began as a project on homelessness. During a research project at the Austin Center for Design, Alex and Ruby realized people lack a channel to give and share their skills, which indirectly hurts their emotional abilities to believe they can change their situation. HourSchool was built based on the belief that everyone has someone to teach. Our mission is to help people realize that, and fulfill the financial and emotional needs that comes along with teaching... <a href="/story" style="font-weight: 700; color: #ff7733">[Continue reading]</a></p>

      <div class="heading15-campaign">Can I get a tax deductible receipt for my contributions?</div>
      <p>This is not a donation to Front Steps nor Greendoors. The peer teaching fund will be used explicitly by HourSchool to create programs at these organization by working very closely with them. The money collected is used towards covering the costs, such as events, material, and salary. We are committed to make this sustainable so we don't want to be dependent on grant cycles that these organizations might or might not receive. If you're interested in donating to these two organizations directly, please visit their websites to find out more.</p>
      
      <div class="heading15-campaign">How do I know if these peer teaching programs are working?</div>
      <p>We will be working with a vulnerable population - though talented, are all going through different challenges. We are confident that a peer teaching program is a very direct way to help them gain self-esteem and recovery from homelessness, but we don't expect overnight success and are prepared to partner with these two organizations for the long term to see through till the end.</p>
      
      <div class="heading15-campaign">I work for a non-profit and I'm interested in a similar program to this. What should I do?</div>
      <p>We would love to work with you and inspire more organizations to adopt the peer teaching model. Please email us at hello@hourschool.com and we will chat more.</p>
