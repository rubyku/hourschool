        <div class="heading15-campaign">What is the peer teaching fund?</div>
        <p>HourSchool has partnered with two organizations working to serve those who have lost their homes. We are collaborating and co-designing to help build a series of educational and capacity building programs, with a goal to instill a sense of self-worth for those who have lost hopes. </p>
      
        <div class="heading15-campaign">How you can help</div>
        <p>Teach a class or ask someone else to teach a class, and choose to donate your class proceeds towards our peer teaching fund! The fund will be used to plan events, cover cost of materials, and compensate time for trainers. Throughout our program, you will receive progress updates from HourSchool. You canâ€™t donate directly without teaching. Start teaching today, so you can empower someone else to do the same. </p>

        <p>HourSchool began as a project on homelessness. During a research project at the Austin Center for Design, Alex and Ruby realized people lack a channel to give and share their skills, which indirectly hurts their emotional abilities to believe they can change their situation. HourSchool was built based on the belief that everyone has someone to teach. Our mission is to help people realize that, and fulfill the financial and emotional needs that comes along with teaching... <a href="/story" style="font-weight: 700; color: #ff7733">[Continue reading]</a></p>
